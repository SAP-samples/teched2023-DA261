## Summary

# Exercise 2 ‚Äì Advanced Planning with Data Actions and Multi Actions

**Objective:** You will develop a basic understanding how to
create and execute data action and multi actions.  You will explore data action tracing, which
is useful for debugging data actions and will create parameters to streamline
the execution of data/multi actions

**Estimated Time:** 45 mins

**Exercise Description:**  Now that the sales quantity has been uploaded to
the sales model, we are going to create a data action to calculate sales
revenue and an allocation to distribute retail returns to the product level
based on our expected sales revenue.  In
the last step of the exercise, we will transfer our sales plan to our financial
plan.

**Key Features:**

* Creation of data action to streamline calculations.

    o   Create data action parameters to streamline execution.

    o   Create a simple advanced formula for sales revenue calculation.

    o   Create an allocation rule to allocate retail expenses.

    o   Creating a cross model copy rule, which aggregates data based on region.

* Executing a trace on a data action and
  reviewing results.
* Creating a multi-action to orchestrate data
  actions.

* Format trigger within the story and map
  parameters.

‚ö†Ô∏è**Disclaimer** When
completing exercises, it is expected that data values or screenshots should
match what you see on your screen.  If
you see inconsistencies as you work through the exercise, please refer to the
appropriate section in **Getting Started** Readme.  For any inconsistencies which are not
addressed therein, please check with your instructor.

üö©As a FP&A Analyst for CycleBros, we are interested in
automating the calculation framework for our planning scenario.  We will automate the calculation via data and
multi actions, which we will create as part of this exercise.  We will learn how to execute traces on data
actions and then how to include all this logic into a story.

Let‚Äôs start by editing the dashboard to show
the finance plan.  This will make it easy
to eventually see how our sales planning activities transfer to the finance
plan near the end of the exercise.

6. We are now going to adjust the layout of the sales
   planning table.  Our first step will be select
   the table object, select edit mode for the story, the right design panel and
   then the builder panel.  This will allow
   us to redefine the definition of the table object.

![](file:////Users/I818705/Library/Group%20Containers/UBF8T346G9.Office/TemporaryItems/msohtmlclip/clip_image001.png)

Adjust
the table definition to match the definition provided below. For  **Account** ,
we will filter on Gross Revenue and for **Measures** we will filter on
Quantity and Amount.

![](file:////Users/I818705/Library/Group%20Containers/UBF8T346G9.Office/TemporaryItems/msohtmlclip/clip_image002.png)

We
will enable null suppression to remove the null rows from the report.

![](file:////Users/I818705/Library/Group%20Containers/UBF8T346G9.Office/TemporaryItems/msohtmlclip/clip_image003.png)

We
will now collapse the hierarchy of the report so that we are only looking at an
overview of our sales plan.

![](file:////Users/I818705/Library/Group%20Containers/UBF8T346G9.Office/TemporaryItems/msohtmlclip/clip_image004.png)

Once
we close the right builder pane and resize the table, your results should look
like this:

![](file:////Users/I818705/Library/Group%20Containers/UBF8T346G9.Office/TemporaryItems/msohtmlclip/clip_image005.png)

We
are now going to create a table that shows our Finance data.  As part of this exercise, we are going to
integrate our sales plan into the finance plan so we will add a table showing
finance data so we can showcase this integration.  To begin, we will duplicate the Sales
Quantity table, reposition it and then open up the builder panel so we can
select our finance model.

![](file:////Users/I818705/Library/Group%20Containers/UBF8T346G9.Office/TemporaryItems/msohtmlclip/clip_image006.png)

Acknowledge
the warning and then select the finance model.

![](file:////Users/I818705/Library/Group%20Containers/UBF8T346G9.Office/TemporaryItems/msohtmlclip/clip_image007.png)

![](file:////Users/I818705/Library/Group%20Containers/UBF8T346G9.Office/TemporaryItems/msohtmlclip/clip_image008.png)

Set
the table layout and filters as shown

![](file:////Users/I818705/Library/Group%20Containers/UBF8T346G9.Office/TemporaryItems/msohtmlclip/clip_image009.png)

Rename
the table to Finance () and then add dynamic text between the ‚Äú()‚Äù for the
version.

![](file:////Users/I818705/Library/Group%20Containers/UBF8T346G9.Office/TemporaryItems/msohtmlclip/clip_image010.png)

Select
the Version item from the Input Controls selections.

![](file:////Users/I818705/Library/Group%20Containers/UBF8T346G9.Office/TemporaryItems/msohtmlclip/clip_image011.png)

‚ö†Ô∏è **Quality
Check!** Does your refreshed dashboard
(including upload results) look like this? Note: The right planning panel may
need to be de-selected from the meu to replicate this view.

![](file:////Users/I818705/Library/Group%20Containers/UBF8T346G9.Office/TemporaryItems/msohtmlclip/clip_image012.png)

Save
your story.

![](file:////Users/I818705/Library/Group%20Containers/UBF8T346G9.Office/TemporaryItems/msohtmlclip/clip_image013.png)

 From the main menu, select  **Files** , our  **Workspace** ,
then DA261-User Content and then your user folder.  We can now select the ‚Äú+‚Äù button to add a
Data Action.  This data action will be
used to calculate gross sales based on quantity and price.   We will then extend this data action to
allocate Retail Returns to the subregions of the United States based on our
calculated Gross Sales values.

![](file:////Users/I818705/Library/Group%20Containers/UBF8T346G9.Office/TemporaryItems/msohtmlclip/clip_image014.png)

Enter
a name like ‚ÄúCalculate_Sales_&_Returns‚Äù and select the Sales Model from the
model folder within our workspace.  This
is the same sales model we were using when we were creating our story.  When complete, save the data action to your
folder.

![](file:////Users/I818705/Library/Group%20Containers/UBF8T346G9.Office/TemporaryItems/msohtmlclip/clip_image015.png)

Validate
that you are saving the data action to your user folder.

![](file:////Users/I818705/Library/Group%20Containers/UBF8T346G9.Office/TemporaryItems/msohtmlclip/clip_image016.png)

We
are going to add an advanced formulae to calculate gross sales from quantity
and price.  We are going to open the
content menu so we can restrict the scope of the calculation.

![](file:////Users/I818705/Library/Group%20Containers/UBF8T346G9.Office/TemporaryItems/msohtmlclip/clip_image017.png)

However,
before we restrict the context, we are going to create a parameter to restrict
the calculation to our user id.

![](file:////Users/I818705/Library/Group%20Containers/UBF8T346G9.Office/TemporaryItems/msohtmlclip/clip_image018.png)

Give
your parameter a name like ‚ÄúUser‚Äù and then make the appropriate settings as
shown.  When complete save your Data
Action.  Select the advanced formula item
that we were starting to configure before we created our parameter.

![](file:////Users/I818705/Library/Group%20Containers/UBF8T346G9.Office/TemporaryItems/msohtmlclip/clip_image019.png)

Give
the step a name like ‚ÄúCalculate Sales‚Äù.
Next configure the context as shown.
Note that for the PLAN_CONTRIBUTOR. You will need to select the USER
parameter you have just created from the parameter list within the selection
popup. Once the context is set, we will start the process of building a
graphical calculation to calculate gross sales.

![](file:////Users/I818705/Library/Group%20Containers/UBF8T346G9.Office/TemporaryItems/msohtmlclip/clip_image020.png)

We
are going to calculate the Gross Sales Amount by taking the price, which is stored
at the Unassigned region multiplied by the sales quantity we uploaded from our
excel file.

![](file:////Users/I818705/Library/Group%20Containers/UBF8T346G9.Office/TemporaryItems/msohtmlclip/clip_image021.png)

‚ö†Ô∏è**Quality Check!** Please
check that your advanced formula is identical to what is shown below.

![](file:////Users/I818705/Library/Group%20Containers/UBF8T346G9.Office/TemporaryItems/msohtmlclip/clip_image022.png)

We
are now going to add an allocation step so that we can allocate retail returns
to our sub-regions (i.e. North, East, South and West).

![](file:////Users/I818705/Library/Group%20Containers/UBF8T346G9.Office/TemporaryItems/msohtmlclip/clip_image023.png)

Configure
the allocation rules as shown and then save your rule.  In this case, we have already planned retail
return values for 2024 for the entire region, which is stored in the Unassigned
region.  We are going to allocate these
values by the gross sales we previously calculated for each subregion.

![](file:////Users/I818705/Library/Group%20Containers/UBF8T346G9.Office/TemporaryItems/msohtmlclip/clip_image024.png)

We
are now going to set the trace points on the data actions.

![](file:////Users/I818705/Library/Group%20Containers/UBF8T346G9.Office/TemporaryItems/msohtmlclip/clip_image025.png)

Set
the trace points as shown by selecting these areas on the data action flow.  This will allow us to see data action changes
between steps.

![](file:////Users/I818705/Library/Group%20Containers/UBF8T346G9.Office/TemporaryItems/msohtmlclip/clip_image026.png)

We
can also select trace points within advanced formulas.  Here we are going to set a trace point where
we are calculating gross sales.  Notice
that we also see a new tracing point added on the Tracing pane on the right
side of the screen.

![](file:////Users/I818705/Library/Group%20Containers/UBF8T346G9.Office/TemporaryItems/msohtmlclip/clip_image027.png)

Please
select the 2024 Plan and your User ID for the data input parameters.

![](file:////Users/I818705/Library/Group%20Containers/UBF8T346G9.Office/TemporaryItems/msohtmlclip/clip_image028.png)

We
are now going to select the Show Table to Review the results of the first
step.  Notice that our selection
parameters will be shown in the right pane for transparency.

![](file:////Users/I818705/Library/Group%20Containers/UBF8T346G9.Office/TemporaryItems/msohtmlclip/clip_image029.png)

‚ö†Ô∏è**Quality Check!** Please
check that your trace window should be identical to what is shown below.

![](file:////Users/I818705/Library/Group%20Containers/UBF8T346G9.Office/TemporaryItems/msohtmlclip/clip_image030.png)

As
we configure the table, you may need to change the **Display Options** to  **Description** .

![](file:////Users/I818705/Library/Group%20Containers/UBF8T346G9.Office/TemporaryItems/msohtmlclip/clip_image031.png)

Configure
the table as shown.  Notice that price is
stored at the unassigned region and that the Amount has not been calculated.

![](file:////Users/I818705/Library/Group%20Containers/UBF8T346G9.Office/TemporaryItems/msohtmlclip/clip_image032.png)

Select
the tracing point for Calculate_Sales.
Here we will see the results tracepoint for the calculation we created
in our advanced formula. If we had multiple calculation lines in our advanced
formula, we could have set multiple trace points.  Also note that we can also explore the
calculation scope for our advanced formula on the right pane.

![](file:////Users/I818705/Library/Group%20Containers/UBF8T346G9.Office/TemporaryItems/msohtmlclip/clip_image033.png)

If
you would like, you can also select values from the Watch Area table and use
the copy button to copy them to the clipboard.
These values can be then pasted into a document like Excel for further
analysis.  While we are showing this
capability, we have not included exercise steps to paste these values into
other documents.

![](file:////Users/I818705/Library/Group%20Containers/UBF8T346G9.Office/TemporaryItems/msohtmlclip/clip_image034.png)

Next,
we are going to select the tracing steps after our Calculate_Sales advanced
formulas has executed.  As we only have
one calculation in our advanced formula, the results of this table should match
the previous trace point.  Notice that we
do not see any values for Retail Returns as this will be addressed in our
allocation step.

![](file:////Users/I818705/Library/Group%20Containers/UBF8T346G9.Office/TemporaryItems/msohtmlclip/clip_image035.png)

Selectin
the AFTER Allocate Expected Returns, we can see that the Retail Returns from
the unassigned region (i.e. ‚Äò#‚Äô), to each of the subregions based on Gross
Sales.

![](file:////Users/I818705/Library/Group%20Containers/UBF8T346G9.Office/TemporaryItems/msohtmlclip/clip_image036.png)

The
Trace creates a private version, which can be viewed in the story we
created.  Since we will not be doing
anything with this this trace version we will delete the information.

![](file:////Users/I818705/Library/Group%20Containers/UBF8T346G9.Office/TemporaryItems/msohtmlclip/clip_image037.png)

![](file:////Users/I818705/Library/Group%20Containers/UBF8T346G9.Office/TemporaryItems/msohtmlclip/clip_image038.png)

In
case you have not done so before, please **Save** your data action. When we
created the data action, we did it from our personal folder we created in our
workspace.  As the next step, we are
going to create another **Data Action** to load the sales plan into the
finance plan.  We will perform this step
from the main menu to initiate the build activity and then save it to our
personal folder.

![](file:////Users/I818705/Library/Group%20Containers/UBF8T346G9.Office/TemporaryItems/msohtmlclip/clip_image039.png)

Xxxx

![](file:////Users/I818705/Library/Group%20Containers/UBF8T346G9.Office/TemporaryItems/msohtmlclip/clip_image040.png)

Please
give the data action a name like ‚Äú Cross-Model Copy Step‚Äù and then select our
Finance model from the exercise.

![](file:////Users/I818705/Library/Group%20Containers/UBF8T346G9.Office/TemporaryItems/msohtmlclip/clip_image041.png)

We
are going to save this data action to our personal folder.  Note that when creating models, stories and
data/multi-actions, that these objects can be stored within a file structure
for easy organization.

![](file:////Users/I818705/Library/Group%20Containers/UBF8T346G9.Office/TemporaryItems/msohtmlclip/clip_image042.png)

We
are going to create some parameters for the data action.  This will allow us to better control the
scope of the data action.

![](file:////Users/I818705/Library/Group%20Containers/UBF8T346G9.Office/TemporaryItems/msohtmlclip/clip_image043.png)

To
create a parmeter, we will give it a name, set the model to our sales planning
model (i.e. SAP_XPA_SALESPLAN_TE2023).
We will then select our dimension (i.e. PLAN_CONTRIBUTOR) and set the cardinality
to single (vs. multiple values) and the level being a leaf member. As the sales
plan for the purpose of this exercise is organized by user, this will allow us
to pass our user to the data action to restrict its scope.

![](file:////Users/I818705/Library/Group%20Containers/UBF8T346G9.Office/TemporaryItems/msohtmlclip/clip_image044.png)

We
are going to create another parameter for source version.  As we are creating a data action to copy data
between models, this parameter will be used to indicate which version we would
like to copy from the sales plan.

![](file:////Users/I818705/Library/Group%20Containers/UBF8T346G9.Office/TemporaryItems/msohtmlclip/clip_image045.png)

Please
give the parameter a name, such as ‚ÄúSVersion‚Äù and set the model to
SAP_XPA_SALESPLAN_TE2023.  We are going
to assign the dimension to Version and the cardinality to single, which means
we only want to pass a single value via this parameter.  We will then enter the default value of ‚Äú2024
Plan.‚Äù  Although we have set a default
value, the user can override this value when the data action is executed.

![](file:////Users/I818705/Library/Group%20Containers/UBF8T346G9.Office/TemporaryItems/msohtmlclip/clip_image046.png)

We
are now going to create our **cross-model copy** step to copy data from our
sales plan to our finance plan.

![](file:////Users/I818705/Library/Group%20Containers/UBF8T346G9.Office/TemporaryItems/msohtmlclip/clip_image047.png)

Please
give the parameter a name, such as ‚Äú **Sales 2 Finance** ‚Äù and set the model
to SAP_XPA_SALESPLAN_TE2023.  We are
going to assign set the filters for **Version** and Plan **Contributor**
as shown.  When selecting the filter
value, you will need to select **Parameters** on the pane on the left side
of the popup window to select the parameters you have previously created.

![](file:////Users/I818705/Library/Group%20Containers/UBF8T346G9.Office/TemporaryItems/msohtmlclip/clip_image048.png)

Using
drag and drop, map the source dimension to the target dimensions.  Note that you will not be able to map
SAP_XPA_COSTCENTER as this dimension is not included in the finance model.  We will want to select this dimension and
manually map it to the **Sales & Marketing** cost center.

![](file:////Users/I818705/Library/Group%20Containers/UBF8T346G9.Office/TemporaryItems/msohtmlclip/clip_image049.png)

Select
the measures mapping so we can edit the mapping rules.

![](file:////Users/I818705/Library/Group%20Containers/UBF8T346G9.Office/TemporaryItems/msohtmlclip/clip_image050.png)

We
are going to create a user defined rule to map the Amount from the sales plan
to Local Currency in our finance plan.   We
are also going to set the auto-generation strategy to ‚Äú **Identical Names and
Compatible Types.** ‚Äù  We could have
also filtered on measures when creating the rule to just include Quantity and
Amount as well.

![](file:////Users/I818705/Library/Group%20Containers/UBF8T346G9.Office/TemporaryItems/msohtmlclip/clip_image051.png)

Now
select the SAP_LOB_REGION.  Here we have
the issue that we have sub-regions assigned to the United States in our sales
plan that have been aggregated to just the United States in our finance plan.

![](file:////Users/I818705/Library/Group%20Containers/UBF8T346G9.Office/TemporaryItems/msohtmlclip/clip_image052.png)

For
the region, select ‚ÄúIdentical names (including Ancestors)‚Äù to map the
subregions from the sales plan to the region in the finance plan.  Using this strategy, we can plan at a
different level in our sales plan than our finance plan.

![](file:////Users/I818705/Library/Group%20Containers/UBF8T346G9.Office/TemporaryItems/msohtmlclip/clip_image053.png)

If
you have not already done so, please save your plan and then select the **Multi
Actions** from the main menu as shown.
With the multi-action, we can bind data actions that we created for our
sales and finance model into a single action we can trigger in a story.

![](file:////Users/I818705/Library/Group%20Containers/UBF8T346G9.Office/TemporaryItems/msohtmlclip/clip_image054.png)

We
are going to create a new Multi Action.

![](file:////Users/I818705/Library/Group%20Containers/UBF8T346G9.Office/TemporaryItems/msohtmlclip/clip_image055.png)

Before
we add the data actions we previously created to our multi-action, we are going
to create some parameters to orchestrate the execution.

![](file:////Users/I818705/Library/Group%20Containers/UBF8T346G9.Office/TemporaryItems/msohtmlclip/clip_image056.png)

We
are going to create parameter called ‚ÄúSVersion‚Äù that will be used transfer what
source version we would like to use from our sales plan.  Please enter the values as shown below.

![](file:////Users/I818705/Library/Group%20Containers/UBF8T346G9.Office/TemporaryItems/msohtmlclip/clip_image057.png)

We
are now going to add another parameter for our userID.   While
we would not normally run a data action by user id, we have added this
parameter as we have many participants running data actions for this exercise
and want to carefully limit our scope.

![](file:////Users/I818705/Library/Group%20Containers/UBF8T346G9.Office/TemporaryItems/msohtmlclip/clip_image058.png)

Please
create the parameter as shown below.

![](file:////Users/I818705/Library/Group%20Containers/UBF8T346G9.Office/TemporaryItems/msohtmlclip/clip_image059.png)

We
are now going to create another parameter for the target version.  Note that for this exercise we could have
just hard-coded these values, but have chosen to include them as parameters to
make them more dynamic.

![](file:////Users/I818705/Library/Group%20Containers/UBF8T346G9.Office/TemporaryItems/msohtmlclip/clip_image060.png)

Please
create the version as shown below.

![](file:////Users/I818705/Library/Group%20Containers/UBF8T346G9.Office/TemporaryItems/msohtmlclip/clip_image061.png)

Select
the + button and then add a  **Data Action Step** . This is where we will
start to attach the data actions we previously created to the multi-action.

![](file:////Users/I818705/Library/Group%20Containers/UBF8T346G9.Office/TemporaryItems/msohtmlclip/clip_image062.png)

Select
the data action that you have previously created, which should be stored in
your user folder.  Please  configure the parameters as well.

![](file:////Users/I818705/Library/Group%20Containers/UBF8T346G9.Office/TemporaryItems/msohtmlclip/clip_image063.png)

We
will now add another data action to our multi action.  Note that when we create a data action, we
can only assign a single model to it.
When using a multi action, we can include many data action steps to it,
which may be bound to different models.
Our first data action is bound to the sales plan, whereas our second
data action will be bound to the finance plan model.

![](file:////Users/I818705/Library/Group%20Containers/UBF8T346G9.Office/TemporaryItems/msohtmlclip/clip_image064.png)

Configure
the data action as shown and then save the multi-action.  you will need to save the Multi Action to
your personal folder, which will be shown in the following step.

![](file:////Users/I818705/Library/Group%20Containers/UBF8T346G9.Office/TemporaryItems/msohtmlclip/clip_image065.png)

Save
the Multi Action to your personal folder.
Please give it a name like ‚ÄúCalc_Sales_and_Aggregate‚Äù

![](file:////Users/I818705/Library/Group%20Containers/UBF8T346G9.Office/TemporaryItems/msohtmlclip/clip_image066.png)

Open
your main user story that we created in the first part of the exercise.

![](file:////Users/I818705/Library/Group%20Containers/UBF8T346G9.Office/TemporaryItems/msohtmlclip/clip_image067.png)

Navigate
to the second page of the worksheet related to **Sales Plan Entry** and then
select the **Edit** button.  We need
to be in edit mode to add our newly created multi-action into our story.

![](file:////Users/I818705/Library/Group%20Containers/UBF8T346G9.Office/TemporaryItems/msohtmlclip/clip_image068.png)

Add
a **Multi Action Trigger** as shown below.

![](file:////Users/I818705/Library/Group%20Containers/UBF8T346G9.Office/TemporaryItems/msohtmlclip/clip_image069.png)

Open
up the right editing pane and then select your multi action that you have just
created form your personal folder.  Assign
the parameters as shown below.  Press the
formatting button so we can format the trigger in the next step.

![](file:////Users/I818705/Library/Group%20Containers/UBF8T346G9.Office/TemporaryItems/msohtmlclip/clip_image070.png)

We
are now going to format the trigger.  While
you are free to select any color, we have provided a hex number as well for a
particular shade of blue.

![](file:////Users/I818705/Library/Group%20Containers/UBF8T346G9.Office/TemporaryItems/msohtmlclip/clip_image071.png)

![](file:////Users/I818705/Library/Group%20Containers/UBF8T346G9.Office/TemporaryItems/msohtmlclip/clip_image072.png)

Please
reposition the Multi Action and then **Save** your story.  We will then select the **View** mode as
we get ready to execute the Multi Action.

![](file:////Users/I818705/Library/Group%20Containers/UBF8T346G9.Office/TemporaryItems/msohtmlclip/clip_image073.png)

Navigate to
the Sales Plan Entry Page.

‚ö†Ô∏è**Quality Check!** Please
check that your sales story page should be identical to what is shown below.

![](file:////Users/I818705/Library/Group%20Containers/UBF8T346G9.Office/TemporaryItems/msohtmlclip/clip_image074.png)

Press
the **Multi Action** button to execute it.
The prompts in this case should be 2024 Plan for both the source and
target version.

![](file:////Users/I818705/Library/Group%20Containers/UBF8T346G9.Office/TemporaryItems/msohtmlclip/clip_image075.png)

We
should now see the sales plan values transferred to the finance plan.  We can expand the hierarchies to get a better
sense of the plan transfer.

**Congratulations, you have completed Exercise
2!**

**You are now able to:**

* Create and execute data and multi-actions.
* Perform tracking on data action steps.
