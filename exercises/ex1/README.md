üö©As a FP&A Analyst for CycleBros, we are interested in
extending the existing dashboard that incorporates Business Intelligence and
Planning.   Start by reviewing the
initial dashboard.  You will notice that
we have 2 tabs.  The tab first is
tracking financial performance for the current year (currently filtered to All
Regions and the current close period ‚Äì Oct 2023).   In the second tab, we have a sales plan
entry template which is meant to capture sales quantity forecasts by period for
each of products.  Note that we have
included a couple of input controls (i.e., plan version and user) which are
already selected and are not meant to be modified during the exercise (this is
to simplify data capture and data segregation for TechEd).  Additionally, for the purposes simplicity we
have narrowed the exercises to primarily focus on the US region.  We will make a couple of minor changes to dashboard
filters, while also making some additional enhancements to improve end-user
plan entry flexibility.

Let‚Äôs start by editing the dashboard!

1. First ensure you are on the Financial Overview tab.  Then click **Edit to change the dashboard to authoring
   mode.**

üö© The first thing we want to do is make some end-user
requested changes to the Financial Overview page.   This include updating the dashboard title to
dynamic reflect our region filter selection, changing the default filter for
region to focus on the US, and modifying the default drill level for our
P&L in the table widget.

2. In the dashboard title text box, highlight the **DA261**
   and click the delete key

3. With your cursor between the brackets () right-click.  Select  **Add** > **Dynamic Text**

![](file:////Users/I818705/Library/Group%20Containers/UBF8T346G9.Office/TemporaryItems/msohtmlclip/clip_image002.png)

4. From the Insert Dynamic Text popup, select **Story
   Filters** and check the box for **SAP_XPA_REGION **and click the **Create**
   button

![](file:////Users/I818705/Library/Group%20Containers/UBF8T346G9.Office/TemporaryItems/msohtmlclip/clip_image003.png)

5. Now let‚Äôs change the default filter selection for the
   region by clicking on the **SAP_XPA_REGION** filter at the top of the dashboard
   and deselecting the **All** filter

![](file:////Users/I818705/Library/Group%20Containers/UBF8T346G9.Office/TemporaryItems/msohtmlclip/clip_image004.png)

6. Select **United States** and click **Apply Selections**

![](file:////Users/I818705/Library/Group%20Containers/UBF8T346G9.Office/TemporaryItems/msohtmlclip/clip_image005.png)

6. Finally, let‚Äôs change the default drill depth in our
   table by first right-clicking on the **SAP_XPA_ACCOUNT** dimension header within
   the table.  Select  **Drill ** >**
   Level 4**

![](file:////Users/I818705/Library/Group%20Containers/UBF8T346G9.Office/TemporaryItems/msohtmlclip/clip_image006.png)

7. Click **File/Save** to save your dashboard updates

![](file:////Users/I818705/Library/Group%20Containers/UBF8T346G9.Office/TemporaryItems/msohtmlclip/clip_image007.png)

‚ö†Ô∏è**Quality Check!** Does
your dashboard look like this?

![](file:////Users/I818705/Library/Group%20Containers/UBF8T346G9.Office/TemporaryItems/msohtmlclip/clip_image008.png)

üö© Now that we have updated the Financial Overview, we are
next going to make some preliminary changes to the Sales Plan Entry tab to
prepare for the upcoming planning cycle.We are going to add two new widgets.
The first will simplify review of total units planned, while the second
will introduce a custom widget to provide a mechanism for end-users to directly
upload their sales plan numbers from csv or xls.

8. Navigate to the **Sales Plan Entry** tab, and review
   the template

![](file:////Users/I818705/Library/Group%20Containers/UBF8T346G9.Office/TemporaryItems/msohtmlclip/clip_image009.png)

üö© We want to add a a numeric point chart to track full
year total quantity planned.  This number
will ultimately be visible in the table as well, but we want to make it more
prominent the end-user.  Rather than
inserting a net-new chart, we are going to duplicate an existing object and
repoint it.

9. Navigate back to the **Financial Overview** tab, and select
   the Unit Sales numeric point chart

![](file:////Users/I818705/Library/Group%20Containers/UBF8T346G9.Office/TemporaryItems/msohtmlclip/clip_image010.png)

10. From the widget menu select **Copy > Copy To > Sales
    Plan Entry**

12. Move (click and drag) and resize the widget (select
    corner or edge and click-drag) so the right side aligns with the right side of
    the table widget so it appears similar to the screenshot below

![](file:////Users/I818705/Library/Group%20Containers/UBF8T346G9.Office/TemporaryItems/msohtmlclip/clip_image015.png)

13.

    choose **More Options > Show/Hide > Primary Value Labels** to toggle
    off the Gross Sales label

![](file:////Users/I818705/Library/Group%20Containers/UBF8T346G9.Office/TemporaryItems/msohtmlclip/clip_image032.png)

24. Click the **File > Save** menu to save your
    dashboard

![](file:////Users/I818705/Library/Group%20Containers/UBF8T346G9.Office/TemporaryItems/msohtmlclip/clip_image033.png)

‚ö†Ô∏è[**Quality Check!**]() Does your Sales Plan
Entry tab look as follows? Note: the Plan_Contributor input control will
reflect your user ID

![](file:////Users/I818705/Library/Group%20Containers/UBF8T346G9.Office/TemporaryItems/msohtmlclip/clip_image034.png)

üö© Now that we have made basic updates to the input
template, we are going to introduce some scripting components to leverage a
custom widget allowing end-users to directly upload a csv or xls from their
local computer.

25. Open the **Left Side Panel**

![](file:////Users/I818705/Library/Group%20Containers/UBF8T346G9.Office/TemporaryItems/msohtmlclip/clip_image036.png)

26. Under the **Assets** menu, expand **Custom Widgets**

![](file:////Users/I818705/Library/Group%20Containers/UBF8T346G9.Office/TemporaryItems/msohtmlclip/clip_image038.png)

27. Select the **Upload XLS v2.0.1** and drag it into an
    open space on the canvass near the top of the tab (note that the widget label
    will disappear once you have finished positioning the widget)

![](file:////Users/I818705/Library/Group%20Containers/UBF8T346G9.Office/TemporaryItems/msohtmlclip/clip_image040.png)

28. From the insert menu let‚Äôs add a new  **Button ** (we‚Äôll
    use this to call our custom widget)

![](file:////Users/I818705/Library/Group%20Containers/UBF8T346G9.Office/TemporaryItems/msohtmlclip/clip_image041.png)

29. Open up the styling menu of the button and change the settings to the following

![](file:////Users/I818705/Library/Group%20Containers/UBF8T346G9.Office/TemporaryItems/msohtmlclip/clip_image043.png)

 üö© Finally, we need to add JavaScript to trigger events in
both the custom widget and the button to call the custom widget.  The custom widget includes multiple custom
events (part of the widget code itself), but in the interest of time we will
only populate two of these with script.  Upon click, the button we inserted in the
previous step will define a series of mappings (based on a predefined structure
of the upload file to the model we are uploading the data into), and then call
the custom widget.    The custom widget has events to 1) display status
information during the file upload process, and 2) process the data into the
model once the file upload is complete including reporting any errors and a
reject file if some records are not loaded.

30. If it is not already visible, then open the Left Side Panel.  Select the **UploadXLS_1** which should
    appear within the **SalesPlanEntry** page in the Outline menu

![](file:////Users/I818705/Library/Group%20Containers/UBF8T346G9.Office/TemporaryItems/msohtmlclip/clip_image044.png)

32. Paste the following Javascript into the function dialog:

*var sheets = UploadXLS_1.getSheetNames();*

*var records =
UploadXLS_1.getTotalRows(sheets[0]);*

*var chunkSize = UploadXLS_1.getChunkSize();*

*if(records <= chunkSize){*

* Application.showBusyIndicator('Uploading
  '+records.toString() + ' rows from the Excel file');*

*}else{*

* Application.showBusyIndicator('Uploading
  first '+chunkSize.toString() + ' rows from the total '+records.toString() +' in
  the Excel file');*

*}*

![](file:////Users/I818705/Library/Group%20Containers/UBF8T346G9.Office/TemporaryItems/msohtmlclip/clip_image047.png)

    event

![](file:////Users/I818705/Library/Group%20Containers/UBF8T346G9.Office/TemporaryItems/msohtmlclip/clip_image048.png)

34. Paste the following Javascript into the function dialog:

*SP_SALESPLAN_TBLE.getDataSource().refreshData();*

*Application.hideBusyIndicator();*

*var status = this.getUploadResult().jobStatus;*

*if (status === sdk_com_sap_sample_uploadxls__2_JobStatus.COMPLETED_WITH_FAILURES){*

* console.log(this.getUploadResult().failedRows);*

    event

![](file:////Users/I818705/Library/Group%20Containers/UBF8T346G9.Office/TemporaryItems/msohtmlclip/clip_image051.png)

36. Paste the following Javascript into the function dialog:

*Application.showMessage(ApplicationMessageType.Error,'There
was an error uploading the Excel data');*

*Application.hideBusyIndicator();*

*console.log(this.getUploadResult());*

37. Select the **BTN_UPLOAD** which should also appear
    within the SalesPlanEntry page in the Outline menu

![](file:////Users/I818705/Library/Group%20Containers/UBF8T346G9.Office/TemporaryItems/msohtmlclip/clip_image052.png)

![](file:////Users/I818705/Library/Group%20Containers/UBF8T346G9.Office/TemporaryItems/msohtmlclip/clip_image055.png)

40. Click the **File > Save** menu to save your
    dashboard

![](file:////Users/I818705/Library/Group%20Containers/UBF8T346G9.Office/TemporaryItems/msohtmlclip/clip_image057.png)

üö© In the final step of exercise 1, we will test our template
changes, including our upload widget.  Recall
where you saved the SalesPlan_Quantity.xls file in the getting started section
as we will use that file for our testing.
Also note that we have not fully coded the upload button as we would in
a production scenario (e.g., process cancellation, error trapping) due to time
considerations, so proceed through these steps slowly.   If you experience any issues, consider
reloading your story ( **View ** > **Reload this Page** in Chrome)

41. Click the View mode button to change from edit mode to
    view mode

![](file:////Users/I818705/Library/Group%20Containers/UBF8T346G9.Office/TemporaryItems/msohtmlclip/clip_image059.png)

42. Navigate to the **Sales Plan Entry** tab

![](file:////Users/I818705/Library/Group%20Containers/UBF8T346G9.Office/TemporaryItems/msohtmlclip/clip_image060.png)

**43.  **Ensure the page has fully loaded, and then click on the **User
Upload** button

![](file:////Users/I818705/Library/Group%20Containers/UBF8T346G9.Office/TemporaryItems/msohtmlclip/clip_image062.png)

44. From the file system dialog, locate the **SalesPlan_Quantity.xls**
    file and click **OK**

üö© At this point you should see a popup dialog indicating
that 1008 rows are being uploaded from the Excel file.   This upload may take a few moments after
which you should see the dashboard refresh with the upload quantities.

‚ö†Ô∏è[**Quality Check!**]() Does your refreshed dashboard (including upload
results) look like this? Note: the Plan_Contributor input control will reflect
your user ID
