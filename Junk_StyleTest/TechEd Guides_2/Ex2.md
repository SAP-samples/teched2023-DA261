2 ‚Äì Advanced Planning with Data Actions and Multi Actions </h1>
<p><strong>Objective:</strong>¬†You will develop a basic understanding
how to create and execute data action and multi actions. You will
explore data action tracing, which is useful for debugging data actions
and will create parameters to streamline the execution of data/multi
actions</p>
<p><strong>Estimated Time:</strong>¬†45 mins</p>
<p><strong>Exercise Description:</strong>¬† Now that the sales quantity
has been uploaded to the sales model, we are going to create a data
action to calculate sales revenue and an allocation to distribute retail
returns to the product level based on our expected sales revenue. In the
last step of the exercise, we will transfer our sales plan to our
financial plan.</p>
<p><strong>Key Features:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Creation of data action to streamline calculations.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Create data action parameters to streamline execution.</p></li>
<li><p>Create a simple advanced formula for sales revenue
calculation.</p></li>
<li><p>Create an allocation rule to allocate retail expenses.</p></li>
<li><p>Creating a cross model copy rule, which aggregates data based on
region.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Executing a trace on a data action and reviewing
results.</p></li>
<li><p>Creating a multi-action to orchestrate data actions.</p></li>
<li><p>Format trigger within the story and map parameters.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>‚ö†Ô∏è<strong>Disclaimer</strong>¬†When completing exercises, it is
expected that data values or screenshots should match what you see on
your screen. If you see inconsistencies as you work through the
exercise, please refer to the appropriate section in <strong>Getting
Started</strong> Readme. For any inconsistencies which are not addressed
therein, please check with your instructor.</p>
<p>üö©As a FP&amp;A Analyst for CycleBros, we are interested in
automating the calculation framework for our planning scenario. We will
automate the calculation via data and multi actions, which we will
create as part of this exercise. We will learn how to execute traces on
data actions and then how to include all this logic into a story.</p>
<p>Let‚Äôs start by editing the dashboard to show the finance plan. This
will make it easy to eventually see how our sales planning activities
transfer to the finance plan near the end of the exercise.</p>
<ol start="6" type="1">
<li><p>We are now going to adjust the layout of the sales planning
table. Our first step will be select the table object, select edit mode
for the story, the right design panel and then the builder panel. This
will allow us to redefine the definition of the table object.</p></li>

As part of this exercise, we are going to integrate our sales plan into

Quantity table, reposition it and then open up the builder panel so we
can select our finance model.</p></li>
